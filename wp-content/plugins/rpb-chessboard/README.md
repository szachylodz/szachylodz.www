[Event "1<sup>st</sup> American Chess Congress"]
[Site "New York, NY USA"]
[Date "1857.11.03"]
[Round "4.6"]
[White "Paulsen, Louis"]
[Black "Morphy, Paul"]
[Result "0-1"]

{[pgndiagram][%csl Yf3][%cal Rd3f3,Re6g6,Gg6g1] Morphy took twelve minutes
over his next move, probably to assure himself that the combination was sound
and that he had a forced win in every variation.}
